## Hi, I'm Daniel!

In high school my good friend, Scott Swingle, taught me how to write simple programs on my TI-84 using TI-Basic. It's been seven years since that day and I'm now finishing up the last year of my B.Sc. in Computer Science (Mathematics) at Santa Clara University. I find myself particularly interested in machine learning. I think using clever algorithms, artificial neural networks, and data to solve problems is super cool. I'm also interested in the Computational Cognitive Science approach to designing better learning machines by studying the processes by which humans learn.

I spend my free time:

* Making music - I love listening to music and making music. I'd consider myself decent at playing the piano and saxophone but I'm currently concentrating on learning to play the guitar. I own an Epiphone Sheraton II in ebony and a Cort X5 in metallic red.
* Reading - I tend to binge read a single genre for a few months. Right now, I'm going through a contemporary sci-fi phase. The next book I plan on reading is Liu Cixin's *The Dark Forest*.
* Learning photograph - My elder sister gave me her DSLR (Canon EOS 500D) this past summer and I've been working on improving my composition. I'm excited to take a black and white film photography course this spring. Feel free to check out my [flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/36200327@N06/)!
